  <ul>
  <li>1 (9 inch) single <a href="https://www.inspiredtaste.net/22662/flaky-pie-crust-recipe/">pie crust</a></li>
  <li>3 large eggs</li>
  <li>1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar</li>
  <li>1/3 cup (65g) light brown sugar</li>
  <li>1 (15oz) can or 2 cups homemade pumpkin puree</li>
  <li>3/4 cup (175ml) heavy whipping cream</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
  <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
  <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
  <li>1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
</ul>

</div>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<a>Preparing the crust</a>
<ol>
<li>Roll out half of the pie dough to fit a 9-inch pie dish (keep the remaining dough chilled). To prevent sticking, sprinkle flour on your work surface and rolling pin. Roll from the center outwards for even thickness, lifting and rotating the dough by a quarter turn as you go. Check the size by inverting the pie dish over the dough (it should be about 2 inches larger).</li>
<li>Carefully place the dough into the pie dish without stretching it, and trim the edges to within 1 inch of the dish. Refrigerate while you prepare your filling.</li>
</ol>
<a>Filling</a>
<ol>
  <li>Whisk the eggs and both sugars together until smooth. Add pumpkin puree, cream, vanilla, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and salt. Whisk until well blended.</li>
</ol>
<a>Bake the pie</a>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 425°F (218°C). Set aside a large baking sheet.</li>
  <li>Place the pie dish on your baking sheet. Pour the pumpkin filling into the pie shell.</li>
  <li>Bake the pumpkin pie at 425°F (218°C) for 15 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 375°F (190°C) and bake for 35 to 45 minutes or until a toothpick or thin knife plunged it into the pie, about 2 inches from the edge, comes out clean. Rotate once or twice during baking. If, while the pie is baking, the top of the crust becomes too dark, cover it with a thin strip of aluminum foil.</li>
  <li>Cool completely on a wire rack for 2 to 3 hours or until room temperature. Serve or refrigerate overnight (the pie sets even more after a night in the fridge).</li>
  <li>Cut into eight wedges and serve alone or topped with whipped cream.</li>

</ol>
<a>Can last 2 hours out in open,3 days in fridge, and 3 months in freezer(wrapped in foil, defrosted in fridge overnight)</a>
